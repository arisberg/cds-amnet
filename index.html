                    <h2>Company</h2>

                    <p class="highlight">Custom Data Systems, Inc. (CDS) was founded in 1985 by Mark Breen to provide custom FoxBase programming and database services to the local Richmond Virginia market. In 1988 the company contracted to convert the Virginia CPA Society’s DEC mini based membership system to a micro-based system, which in those days meant IBM 286’s.</p>
                    <p>In 1990, other CPA societies expressed interest and the rest -- as they say -- is history. CDS dubbed the package “The Association Manager”, Ver 1.0 (AM1), and committed 100% of its resources towards its development and sale to state CPA Societies.</p>
                    <p>We build and treasure our close relationships with our customers and are often considered more of an offsite developer team rather than an arm’s length vendor.</p>
